From the start of the pandemic in 2020 to our current situation now, we have seen a rise in hate-related crime
including, but not limited to assault, murder, verbal abuse and property damage. As a team, we have noticed that these came about as a result of increasing racial tensions exasperated by the pandemic which encouraged misplaced blame and subsequent racial violence. However, hate crimes are not a recent phenomenon and extend beyong racial identities. In our research for this project, we have found that hate crimes have predated the start of the century and include violence towards members of the LGBTQ community, various religous groups, ethnicity, persons with disability and gender. And so our project will be addressing the data science problem of how human well-being in cities and states influence hate crimes over the years. Given hate crime data at the incident level from 1991 to 2020 compiled by the FBI, our solution will address the impact of demographics such as income,education and diversity on hate crime, trends in types of hate crimes committed and suggestions for areas of improvement. 

<TimeLine>
According to FBI statistics, Hate crimes in the United States have reached an all-time high. The most recent spike in hate crime heralds a new cruel landscape in which targeted attacks against victim groups not only result in spikes, but also widespread increases in the most violent crimes. This comes amid a rise in public and political discourse that devalues members of unfamiliar groups and to targeted aggression. We investigate the underlying tendency of hate crimes over the years, specifically from 1991 to 2020. To further glean a comprehensive understanding, we will explore specific patterns pertaining to an offender’s bias against a race or ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity. As a team, We seek to portray both the shift in patterns over time and the factors behind the shifts through each category of incidents. Therefore, we analyze the history of what some activists refer to as the “Hate Crime Epidemic” in the United States.
