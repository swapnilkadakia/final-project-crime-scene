A short summary (3-4 paragraphs, about one page) of the data science problem you are addressing and what your solution will address. Feel free to include a figure or sketch to illustrate your project.

From the start of the pandemic in 2020 to our current situation now, we have seen a rise in hate-related crime
including, but not limited to assault, murder, verbal abuse and property damage. As a team, we have noticed that these came about as a result of increasing racial tensions exasperated by the pandemic which encouraged misplaced blame and subsequent racial violence. However, hate crimes are not a recent phenomenon and extend beyong racial identities. In our research for this project, we have found that hate crimes have predated the start of the century and include violence towards members of the LGBTQ community, various religous groups, ethnicity, persons with disability and gender. And so our project will be addressing the data science problem of how human well-being in cities and states influence hate crimes over the years. Given hate crime data at the incident level from 1991 to 2020 compiled by the FBI, our solution will address the impact of demographics such as income,education and diversity on hate crime, trends in types of hate crimes committed and suggestions for areas of improvement. 

The increase in hate crime over the years has resulted in hate crime reaching its peak in multiple US states. Through this project, we plan on invesigating the factors of each state that have a direct correlation with the increasing hate crime. One of the major factors that we will be looking at is the overall well being of each state. This includes the state's overall educated population, income rates, health care facilities, and age groups to name a few. The well being of each state combined with the crime rates will enable us to undersand the distribution of hate crime across US states based on the type of hate crime and the total hate crime registered cases. This data can be further used by governments to identify the target groups in each state and provide laws that protect these target groups.

According to FBI statistics, Hate crimes in the United States have reached an all-time high. The most recent spike in hate crime heralds a new cruel landscape in which targeted attacks against victim groups not only result in spikes, but also widespread increases in the most violent crimes. This comes amid a rise in public and political discourse that devalues members of unfamiliar groups and to targeted aggression. We investigate the underlying tendency of hate crimes over the years, specifically from 1991 to 2020. To further glean a comprehensive understanding, we will explore specific patterns pertaining to an offender’s bias against a race or ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity. As a team, We seek to portray both the shift in patterns over time and the factors behind the shifts through each category of incidents. Therefore, we analyze the history of what some activists refer to as the “Hate Crime Epidemic” in the United States.

To tell a good story from data, the most important thing you need is an acceptable dataset. We aim to gather data from multiple sources as we progress through the project. We are currently focused on using the Hate_Crime dataset provided by the FBI. The dataset concentrates on hate crimes that have occured in different cities across the United States from 1991 to 2020.
Some of the features included in this dataset are incident date, location, offender race, offense name. There are 219,578 rows in the dataset which gives us a good amount of information to work with and draw conclusions.

The ultimate goal of our project is to make this world a safe space where every individual can express themselves and to build a society where every race has equal rights and freedom. To help recognize what features/demographics are most influencing the number of hate crimes in a region, we would lastly implement a machine learning model to gain insights with the help of feature importance. This will then help us in coming up with a solution based on the features that most influence the hate crimes.
